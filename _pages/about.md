I am a Software Engineer at `Google` and a PhD Student in Computer Science at `National Taiwan University`, advised by Prof. [Winston Hsu](https://winstonhsu.info/). Previously, I was a Senior Computer Vision Engineer at `HTC`. Prior to that, I earned my Master's Degree from National Tsing Hua University and my Bachelor's from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, both in Computer Science.

My research focuses on teaching AI systems to see and understand human actions in videos.

My work is about building AI systems that understand human movements, poses and interactions.
